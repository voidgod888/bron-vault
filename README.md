# Broń Vault

Broń Vault is an open-source stealer logs dashboard designed to simplify the process of analyzing stealer log data. 

> 💡 If you're new to this concept, we recommend reading our introductory article on our blog: ['Stealer Logs: Perspectives on Attack and Defense in a Silent Epidemic, and How Broń Vault Automates the Parsing Process'](https://blog.intellibron.io/stealer-logs-perspectives-on-attack-and-defense-in-a-silent-epidemic-and-how-bron-vault-automates-the-parsing-process/).

Forget complex ad-hoc scripts. With Broń Vault, you can simply drag and drop `.zip` log files into the web interface. The application automatically parses the data and presents it in a structured format, ready for inspection.

Our goal is to support the day-to-day needs of security teams on the front lines by providing a practical alternative to manual scripting or overly complex platforms typically required for stealer log analysis. This project reflects our mission to democratize security, making foundational analysis capabilities accessible to everyone and allowing analysts to focus on critical decision-making instead of manual log parsing.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This tool was developed as a side project and is not intended for production use. Please see the [Important Notice](#important-notice) section below.

    - **Credentials Tab**: View all credentials associated with the domain, including URLs, usernames, passwords, log dates, and direct links to correlated devices.

  * **Statistical Dashboard**: Get a strategic overview of the data through clear visualizations, including:
      - Total domains and URLs (including IPs)
      - Total credentials
      - Total files extracted
      - Top 5 most common passwords
      - Top 10 TLDs
      - Top 10 most affected browsers
      - Top 10 most used software
        
  * **Debug-Zip Utility**: Perform a quick check on `.zip` files to analyze their internal structure, ensure they match supported formats, and flag directories missing a password file.
    
  * **Simple RSS Feeds**: Integrated RSS feeds from **ransomware.live** and **malware-traffic-analysis.net** to keep you updated on the latest threats.

## Important Notice

- This tool was built with a focus on functionality, not hardened security. Do **NOT** deploy this in production environment or expose it to public networks. Use it exclusively in a secure, **isolated** environment.
- Broń Vault was developed by [Tomi Ashari](https://github.com/mastomii) and [YoKo Kho](https://github.com/yokokho) as a side project under the [ITSEC Asia](https://itsec.asia/) RnD Division, with support from AI-assisted tooling. It does not represent our commercial [IntelliBroń Threat Intelligence](https://intellibron.io/) platform, though it reflects some similar capabilities.

-----

## Getting Started

### Architecture & Performance

Broń Vault utilizes a modern, containerized architecture:

1.  **Next.js App**: The main web interface and API.
2.  **MySQL 8.0**: Primary transactional database.
3.  **ClickHouse**: Analytical database for high-performance querying, synchronized via MaterializedMySQL.
4.  **Redis**: High-performance job queue for background tasks.
5.  **Scanner Worker**: Dedicated service for active asset scanning (ports, SSL, etc.).

**Automatic Data Synchronization:** ClickHouse automatically replicates data from MySQL through MaterializedMySQL. Once configured, every change in MySQL is synced to ClickHouse in real-time.

> 💡 **Simple Setup!** We've created a complete Docker service setup that handles all the configuration automatically. Just run a single script, and everything -> MySQL, ClickHouse, Redis, Scanner, and the Next.js application, will be set up and ready to use.

Follow these steps to get Broń Vault up and running locally.

### Prerequisites

  * **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed and running
    * Docker Desktop: [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
    * Linux: Install via package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install docker.io docker-compose`)
  * Git (for cloning the repository)

### Tested Environments

This application has been successfully tested on the following operating systems:

  * Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
  * Kali Linux 2025.3
  * macOS Sequoia

### Installation & Running

#### Quick Start (Recommended)

1.  **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ITSEC-Research/bron-vault
    cd bron-vault
    ```

2.  **Configure the Environment:**

    ```bash
    # Copy the example environment file
    cp .env.example .env
    
    # Edit .env with your secure passwords
    # IMPORTANT: Change all default passwords for security!
    ```

3.  **Start all services:**

    **For Linux/macOS:**
    Run the script with elevated privileges:

    ```bash
    sudo bash docker-start.sh
    ```

    As a note, this script will:
    - Build Docker images (only on the first run)
    - Start MySQL, ClickHouse, Redis, Scanner Worker, and the Next.js application
    - Run the setup script to configure MaterializedMySQL replication
    - Display service status and access URLs

4.  **Access the application:**

    Open your browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

#### Default Login Credentials

After the first startup, you can log in with:

- **Email:** `admin@bronvault.local`
- **Password:** `admin`

> ⚠️ **Security Note:** Please change the default password immediately after first login!

#### Service URLs

Once all services are running, you can access:

- **Bron Vault App:** http://localhost:3000
- **ClickHouse Play:** http://localhost:8123/play
- **MySQL:** localhost:3306
- **ClickHouse HTTP API:** http://localhost:8123

#### Useful Commands

**Check service status:**
```bash
# Linux/macOS
./docker-status.sh
```

**View logs:**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

**Stop all services:**
```bash
docker-compose down
```

**Restart services:**
```bash
docker-compose restart
```

**Run Telegram Scraper:**
```bash
docker exec -it bronvault_app npm run scraper:telegram
```

### Initial Setup

The first time you start the services:

1. The setup script will automatically:
   - Create MySQL replication user for ClickHouse sync
   - Configure MaterializedMySQL database in ClickHouse
   - Initialize all database tables and indexes

2. Wait for all services to be ready (usually about 60 seconds)

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000` and log in with the default credentials above

4. **Important:** Change the default password immediately after first login

You are now ready to start using Broń Vault!
Just upload the stealer logs, and it will automatically parse them.
